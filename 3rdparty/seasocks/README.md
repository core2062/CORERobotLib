Seasocks - A tiny embeddable C++ HTTP and WebSocket server
==========================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mattgodbolt/seasocks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mattgodbolt/seasocks)

Features
--------
*   Simple C++ API
*   Serves static content from disk
*   API for building WebSocket servers
*   Simple command line binary for quick serving of static files only
*   Supports newer Hybi-10 and Hybi-16 WebSockets as well as the older Hixie style.

Stuff it doesn't do
-------------------
It's not nearly as configurable as Apache, Lighttpd, Nginx, Jetty, etc.
It provides only limited support for custom content generation (e.g. Servlets).
It has been designed for WebSocket based control.
