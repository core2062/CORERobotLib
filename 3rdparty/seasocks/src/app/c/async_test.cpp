// The AsyncResponse does some long-lived "work" (in this case a big sleep...)
// before responding to the ResponseWriter, in chunks. It uses a new thread to
// perform this "work". As responses can be canceled before the work is
// complete, we must ensure the ResponseWriter used to communicate the response
// is kept alive long enough by holding its shared_ptr in the "work" thread.
// Seasocks will tell the response it has been cancelled (if the connection
// associated with the request is closed); but the ResponseWriter is safe in the
// presence of a closed connection so for simplicity this example does nothing
// in the cancel() method. It is assumed the lifetime of the Server object is
// long enough for all requests to complete before it is destroyed.
